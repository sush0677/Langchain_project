### Generative AI Agents with Langchain - Exquitech Internship

## Project Description
During my internship at **Exquitech**, I worked on a project to explore and understand **Langchain** and its applications in building AI-driven agents. The focus of the project was on leveraging **OpenAI Azure models** to develop intelligent AI agents capable of handling a range of tasks, from data extraction to natural language processing (NLP) based automations.

This project was a part of my learning process to understand the broader scope of **Generative AI** and how AI models can be utilized to create dynamic workflows. I gained hands-on experience with Langchain, building a framework that integrates various AI agents, which interact with each other and perform tasks efficiently.

## Key Contributions:
- **Learning and Understanding Langchain**: Developed a strong understanding of Langchain and its components to build robust AI applications.
- **AI Agent Development**: Created AI agents capable of handling specific tasks such as data retrieval, summarization, and automated decision-making using **OpenAI Azure** models.
- **Generative AI Exploration**: Explored and implemented use cases of Generative AI by combining pre-trained models from OpenAI Azure and integrating them with Langchain.
- **Data Pipeline Creation**: Set up data pipelines that allowed AI agents to extract and process data effectively, applying it to real-world business problems.
- **Model Integration**: Integrated GPT models from OpenAI Azure for complex NLP tasks, enabling the AI agents to perform actions like generating content, answering questions, and more.
- **Hands-on Implementation**: Gained practical experience by developing and testing Langchain workflows, using Python as the primary programming language.

## Technologies Used
- **Langchain** for AI workflow management.
- **OpenAI Azure** models for AI and NLP.
- **Python** for scripting and automation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for development and testing.
- **FAISS and ChromaDB** for data handling and vector storage.

## Internship Overview:
- **Company**: Exquitech
- **Role**: AI/ML Intern
- **Duration**: April 2024 - June 2024
- **Objective**: To explore the capabilities of Generative AI and Langchain in building intelligent AI agents for real-world applications.
